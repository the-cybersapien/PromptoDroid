    <string name="lorem_ipsum">
Your smile so beautiful as the sun that shines through on a warm sunny day.
With a simple flash of that sexy smile, you take my breath aw.
And every time I see your face.
I smile remembering each loving embrace.
Your eyes twinkle like the stars bright in the sky.
Staring deep into caring eyes leaves no questions why.
I lose myself in your entrancing stare.
I feel like to you my soul I could bare.
Your intoxicating smell as sweet as a fully bloomed rose.
Which is just one more reason why it is you that I have chose.
Your familiar scent warms my heart.
And will trigger fond memories if we ever have to part.
Your voice is as calming as the ocean waves meeting the shore.
Teaching me the meaning of feelings I never felt before.
I could spend hours listening to you on the phone.
Reaching a level we have only known
